===========

Pebble app that scrapes and outputs news headlines

To use this app, just download [simply.js](http://simplyjs.io/) to your pebble and point it at [this file here](http://pebblenews.tamara.cool/app.js).

At the moment it only supports ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) news, but the plan for the future is to be able to support more/multiple news sources.

### Upcoming features
- Being able to choose a news source (or multiple sources) from within the app
- Receiving push notifications for new headlines at a particular interval
- Viewing combined headlines from multiple sources
